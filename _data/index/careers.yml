    detail: TGR was a great personal experience to live the Startup`s lifestyle. I learned a lot about best coding practices, about data analysis and agile software development (Scrum, Kanban). 

            My main role was to work as a FullStack developer in a system to manage probes (made in Django), creating features, tests and making the software maintenance. Also, I developed a REST API to allow users to access data from this system and an Authentication tool using NGINX.

            I also worked, in the refactoring of an ETL tool, made in NodeJS and MongoDB and using later using Scala + Apache Spark. 

            Moreover I contributed to the development of a dashboard about network data, using Elasticsearch and Kibana

    detail: As an undergraduate researcher, I participated as a Ph.D. assistant in several research projects. First, I worked analyzing a dataset of a famous video streaming service, using R and statistical packages. Later, my main project was the Gaspare Bruno's research (winner of Google Research Awards Latin America) in his doctorate thesis and in my undergraduate thesis - "Measuring Engagement of Students in Online Videos Lectures". In this project, I worked with logs of an EaD system and with sensors like EEG, EDA and pupil sensor. I used Python and tools like Matplotlib, NumPy, and ScyPy.
